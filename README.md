Credit Card Routing Optimization using Predictive Modeling

Project Overview

In the burgeoning landscape of online retail, ensuring the successful and efficient processing of online credit card payments is pivotal. High transaction failure rates can lead to significant financial setbacks and heightened customer dissatisfaction. This project endeavors to rectify these concerns by automating the credit card routing process through predictive modeling. By meticulously analyzing historical transaction data, we aim to devise a model that optimally selects a Payment Service Provider (PSP) for each transaction, enhancing payment success rates and minimizing transaction fees.

Credit Card Routing Optimization using Predictive Modeling

Project Overview:
In the burgeoning landscape of online retail, ensuring the successful and efficient processing of online credit card payments is pivotal. High transaction failure rates can lead to significant financial setbacks and heightened customer dissatisfaction. This project endeavors to rectify these concerns by automating the credit card routing process through predictive modeling. By meticulously analyzing historical transaction data, we aim to devise a model that optimally selects a Payment Service Provider (PSP) for each transaction, enhancing payment success rates and minimizing transaction fees.

The initiative focuses on tackling the issue of elevated failure rates in online credit card transactions. Through an examination of past transaction data, we aim to construct a predictive model that takes into account diverse factors like transaction amount, customer location, transaction time, and the performance history of payment service providers (PSPs). This model aims to facilitate the smart allocation of transactions to the most appropriate PSP, thereby enhancing payment success rates and customer contentment.

Project Description:
The emphasis of this project is on automating the credit card routing procedure in online retail through the utilization of predictive modeling techniques. Our goal is to enhance the success rate of online credit card payments and minimize transaction fees by creating a model that predicts the optimal payment service provider (PSP) for each transaction.
